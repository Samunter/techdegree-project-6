WHAT IS EXPRESS MIDDLEWARE?

What happens between a request and a response. It is a function with 3 parameters

(request, response, next) => {}

request and response are objects that can be read and modified in the function. next is a function that must be called when the work is done. this triggers the next middleware function to execute

to run middleware in response to requests, pass it to app.use(). This will run the middleware function for every request. to only run it for a specific route, pass a route argument in before the middleware function

app.use('/users', (req, res, next) => {});

to have the middleware run only when a get request is made, use app.get() instead.
